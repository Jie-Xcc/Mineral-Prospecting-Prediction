After handling missing values and standardizing the data, split the dataset into training and test sets. Construct multiple linear regression, random forest, neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) models. Finally, apply SMOTE for sample balancing and evaluate the models on the test set, including metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and AUC.
